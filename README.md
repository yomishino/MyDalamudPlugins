# MyDalamudPlugins

Repo listing my FFXIV Dalamud plugins


## Setup Guide

[XIVLauncher](https://goatcorp.github.io/) is required to install and run the plugins.

In the game, open Dalamud Settings,  
and add the URL below to the __Custom Plugin Repositories__ under the "Experimental" tab:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yomishino/MyDalamudPlugins/main/plugins.json
```

Then install the plugins you'd like to have in Dalamud's Plugin Installer.


## List of Plugins

- [ActionEffectRange](https://github.com/yomishino/FFXIVActionEffectRange)  
    provides a visual cue on the effect range of the AoE action the player has just used
- [AetherCompass](https://github.com/yomishino/FFXIVAetherCompass)  
    automatically detects certain objects/NPCs such as Aether Currents nearby and shows where they are
- [TitleRenamed](https://github.com/yomishino/FFXIVTitleRenamed)  
    rename a title displayed on the nameplates


### Notes on Test Builds

The repo may include test builds of the plugins.

Test builds will be listed in the Plugin Installer 
if the "Get plugin testing builds" setting is enabled in Dalamud Settings
(under the "Experimental" tab).

All test builds have "\[TEST\]" appended at the end of the plugin name.
